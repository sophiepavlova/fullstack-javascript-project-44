# Project Command Line Games

## Description

You will find 5 simple mathematic games here. Each one works similarily: you have 3 attempts, if you are correct in all of them you win. If you make a mistake the game is over, and you may start again.

You will be given a question and asked to type your answer. Typically it is either a number or a yes or no.

The games are:

- **calc** - you need to calculate a simple expression
- **even** - you need to guess if the number is even
- **gcd** - you need to calculate the greatest common divider for two numbers
- **prime** - you need to say if a given number is a prime number
- **progression** - you - you are given am arithmetical progression and you need to guess which number is missing.

## Minimum Requirements

- Node.js (version 18.18.0 or higher)
- npm (version 9.8.0 or higher)

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sophiepavlova/fullstack-javascript-project-44.git
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the games**:
   You can run any game in the Terminal by using the `make` command followed by the game's name. For example:
   ```bash
   make brain-even
   ```
   Replace `even` with other game names ( `calc`, `gcd`, `prime`, `progression`).
